				We offer investment products in the private and public sectors as well as Venture Capital – an excellent solution for small enterprises and newly created companies. Our products are an offer addressed to entrepreneurs, who believe in the success of their venture, want to develop it and move to a higher level. We specialize in financing new companies as well as help in the takeovers, development and diversification of existing companies. Good cooperation is one of the most important business tools, which is why we make every effort to ensure that the products we offer are fully satisfying.
				We fund all local government tasks using the public-private partnership method called BTL (design, build, fund). Our knowledge of matter comes from countries that have extensive experience, such as the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany and France. Our capitals for financing are of EU origin.

				Public-private partnership with ASA Polska S.A. comes with grat benefits – above all, the possibility of implementing investments without an increase in public debt ratios, implementation of social and environmental goals, and implementation of infrastructure projects in the event of limited availability of public contribution.

			<h2>We specialize in servicing the financing of local government units.</h2>
			<br>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The public sector is one of the largest sectors of the national economy, providing basic goods or services that are not or can not be provided by the private sector. The public sector is composed of national and local governments and their agencies. Financing public services usually takes place in various ways, including taxes, fees and financial transfers from other levels of government administration. In the “outsourcing” process, public sector organizations often engage private enterprises in providing goods and services to citizens.

			<br>
			<h3>
				Our offer of public-private partnership is addressed to every unit of the public finance sector, in particular:
			</h3>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>municipalities, counties, provinces</li>
				<li>budget units</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>state higher education institutions</li>
				<li>research and development units</li>

			<ul>
				<li>independent public health care facilities</li>
				<li>other state and local government legal entities</li>

				The private sector includes all profit-making enterprises that are not owned or managed by the government. The private sector is a segment of the national economy, owned, controlled and managed by private persons or enterprises. His main goal is to earn money. The private sector employs many more employees than the public sector. It arises through the creation of a new enterprise or the privatization of public sector organizations. Enterprises from the private sector reduce prices of goods and services while at the same time competing for as many consumers as possible.
